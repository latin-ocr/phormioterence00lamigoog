INTRODUCTION

IV. Puor or'rim Priormo

There were two brothers living at Athens, Demipho and Chremes,
both elderly gentlemen. Demipho was a widower‚ with ason
named Antipho. Chremes had a wife, Nausistrata, and a son
Phaedria. Both the brothers had gone abroad, leaving their

Ἴ sons to the care of Demipho’s confidential slave, Geta, who finds
his hands pretty full in consequence of the escapades of his two
young charges. For Phaedria amuses himself by falling in love
with a pretty little music-girl, whom he is anxious to purchase
from the rascally slave-dealer, Dorio; while Antipho adds still
further to Geta's troubles and anxieties by forming a romantic
attachment to a beautiful girl whom he has seen mouming over
her dead mother, and whom, partly out of love and partly out ol
pity for her friendless state, he has actually married, having found
out that she was of free birth. To enable him to do this, Phormio,
the parasite and friend of the two young cousins, has concocted,
with Antipho’s connivance, a bold and clever plan. By the laws
of Atheus, when a girl was left an orphan and unprovided for, her
nearest eligible male relative was bound either to marry her him-
self or provide her with a suitable dowry. Phormio takes advan-
tage of this law to play a bold game. He trumps up a plausible
story of how he was an old friend of the girl’s father, and with
unblushing impudence swears that Antipho was her nearest male'
relative and was therefore bound to provide for her. Antipho, of
course, offers no defence, and the girl is therefore adjudged to him
by the court, and he carries her off and marries her.

lt is at this point that the action of the play commences. A
letter has been received from Demipho announcing his immediate
retum home. Geta aud Antipho are consequently at their wits'
end. The whole story comes out, and Demipho’s wrath is
specially directed against Phormio, who has contrived the whole
business. He has other views for Antipho and he seeles to get the
marriage' annulled; but though he calls in the assistance of three
sage representatives of the law, he gets but little consolation from
them. What has been done, they say, cannot be undone-and
they gravely pocket their fees. Phormio with hold effrontem
stands to his guns, and tells Demipho it 'is useless to disddmftixs
