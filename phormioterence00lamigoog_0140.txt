18. uberans, ‘a gentleman ’.

fugitans uuum, ‘who fights shy of lawsuits’. The present parti·
ciple loses its verbal character and becomes practieally a substantive, as,

e.g., uorans pumat, ‘a patriot ’.
2ο. auctores mere, ut, dre, ‘advised him to ’, ‘suggested that he should
turn her out neck and crop'. Auctor in this sense of ‘adviser' may also

be followed by a genitive, as Livy v. 20. 5, auctor stipendii numerandi,
‘who proposed that the soldiers’ pay should be paid '.

22. Trans: ‘perhaps you’ll say the law will punish him if he turns her
out? He has looked into thart Itell you, you’ll sweat finelyif you try
conclusions with him—he’s that eloquent !’

25. pono, ‘suppose '3 ah tandem, ‘well‚ after all ⁹, ‘at the worst’.

26. capitis, i.e. if Demipho were to lose his suit, his caput, or civic
rights, would not be endangered‚ as he has money enough to pay the fine
that would be imposed; whereas if Phormio were to lose, as he has no
money to pay the fine, his caput would be in danger, as he would be
adjudged the slave of Demipho.

28, 29. duri ln manum Donatus says this phrase denotes some under·
ppipdmpgnplpgudulent transaction: perhaps ‘to square you' will bring out

30. facessat, ‘take herself off ', ‘make herself scarce '.

38. nimium quantum so in Greek θαυμαστὸν door, ἀμήχανον door.

Livy 2. 1. fin. Trans. ‘a good deal too much '.

39. talentum magnum this was the Attic silver taient of the value of
(1241, 135. 4o¹. (as given by Boeclrh); why it is called magnum is not clear,
as it was not so large as the Euboic taient, which after the Attic talent was
the coin most generally circulated. There were, however, several snraller
coins, ug. the Syracusan or Sieilian talent, with which it may be contrasted,
but probably maguum refers merely to its value, and means nothing mere

than ‘a fine big taient ', without reference to its sire. lior the sehse <h texe
