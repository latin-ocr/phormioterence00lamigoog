Pago Θ

r. adeon rem redlsse. For this exclamatory infinitive see note to
mirarier, 9² (i. 2. 42). The n (=-ne) serves to give an interrogative force
to the exclamation-‘ can it be that things have corne to such a pass’. The
expression is closely parallel with the construction of ut and the subjunc.
in exclamatory questions, which generally insert -ne; cf., for example, with
this verse, 304 (ii. 3. 74) below, egon illam cum illo ut patiar nuptam unum
deeris? Both forms of the question inrply some objection, the difference
being that the acc. and infin. objects to the eiiea, the subjunc. with ut to the ,
state of affairs responsible for such a result (hence ut).

aduenit This is a common form of the genitive of nouns of the 4th

of the genitive anuis ( :anua gen.) in Haut. 287, and rreetuist, 482 (iii. 4
18) of this play. The genitive after uenire in rientem is also found in
Cicero, eg. venit milei Platonis ire mentem (Fin. v. 1. 2); tibi terarum
uirtutum teene'et in mentem (de Orat. ii. 61. 249).

3. qued ni. Cf. note to Prol. 9. Trans. ‘whereas ifI hadn’t been
thoughtless’. S

6. eo inpulisset qnod, ‘to take the step which was the beginning

eo quod lenissimum videbatur decursum est.

7. non potitus essem, ‘I shouldn’t have got possession (of the girl);
illdioum have been wretched these few days ’. Wagner reads allud for
