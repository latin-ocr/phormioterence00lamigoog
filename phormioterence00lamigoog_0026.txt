adds that it was in the seventeenth century, when French literature
was most truly Attic, that he was most appreciated. M. Joubert
is quoted as applying to him the words, ‘Le miel Attique est sur
ses levres; on croirait aisement qu'il naquit sur le mont Hy-
mette'.”¹

'l'he Bulldlnca Popular though dramatic representations were
at Rome from very early times, it was long before any permanent
theatre was built in the city. Whenever a play was to be given, a
temporary wooden stage was erected for the actors at the foot of
a hill, while the audience sat or reclined on the slopes. This was
tbe common practice even in the time of Plautus and Terence,
and it was not till nc. 55 that the first permanent theatre built of
stone was erected by Pompeius. Two other theatres were subse· Ι
quently built, one by Augustus, which he named after his son-in·
law Marcellus, and the other by Lucius Cornelius Balbus. Of
these three buildings there are but slight remains now existing of
the two latter, while of the theatre of Pompey there are no traces
to be found above-ground (Lanciani, Rue'ns aad Excavatebns, pp.
461, 493, 495). The Roman theatres were built on the model of
those of Greece in all essential details. The main difference
between them was that the orchestra, or semicircular space imme-
diately in front of the stage, which in the Greek buildings was used
exclusively for the evolutions of the chorus, was in the Roman
theatres occupied with seats for notable persons, there being no
chorus in Latin comedies to occupy it. An excellent idea of the
stage and auditorium of an ancient theatre is given by the accom-
panying illustrations of the remains of the beautiful Greek theatre
at Taormina in Sicily, in which the arrangement of the seats for
the audience,the shape and size of the stage, and the general
architectural features of the building, are still clearly discemible.

part of the great religious festivals, the chief of which were the
Ludi Megalenses or Megalensia and the Ludi Romani, held in
April and September respectively, under the superintendence of
the curule aediles. They were sometimes, too, given on special
occasions, such as the ludi funerales, funeral games heloissam
