ducimus In interrogative sentences in Early Latin the indicative is
frequently found instead of the more classical subjunctive where the ques·
tion is separated from the principal verb and regarded as an independent
sentence; this is especially the case after such words as dic, responde, uida
terega, sctit, and relative words such as ut, quomodo, quamobrem (as here),
where the relatival and not the interrogative force is the more prominent:
eg. dic, quidest? Pl. Men. 3973 mirumst facinus, quomodo haec transire
potui, Pl. Mil. 377. In the present passage the relatival rather than the
interrogative force of quamobrem is emphasrzed, ‘have you discussed with
Phanium at all tlte reason why we are bringing Nausistrata to herl’ In
classical prose the subjunctive is invariable in such sentences.

quid illa fitia. . . futurumst, ‘what will happen to that daughter
of- our friendl' The ‘friend'‚ of course, is Chremes himself; sonre
significant look or gesture would make this clear. Illa filia is ablative, as
in quid te futurumst ? in 137 (i. 2. 87), where see note.

18. hauc mittimus, ‘are we to drop her? Ch. Why not? De. The other
girl is to remaini’ Hanc is the filia amici nostri 3 illa is Phanium. Demipho
is naturally surprised that Chremes is now anxious to retain Phanium aster
being so eager to et rid of her (cf. 670 (iv. 3. 65) ), and Chremes, of course,
cannot acknowle ge, while his wife is present, that he has discovered that
Phanium is actually his own daughter whom he has wished all along to
marry to his friend's son.

19. quid nit note to 64 (i. 2. 14).

perliberalis, ‘quite a lady’3 cf. 168 (ii. 1. 16), 623 (iv. 3. 18), Ir'beralis.
Nausistrata here leaves the stage, and gives Chremes the opportunity of
explaining matters.
