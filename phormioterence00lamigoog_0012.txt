PREFACE

This edition lays no claim to being critical; it is
intended mainly lor the upper forms os schools as an
introduction to the study ol Plautus and Terence. Only
such critical notes are given as seemed absolutely neces-
sary, and these are put into a separate appendix.

The text adopted is in the main that ol Dziatzlro’s
edition as revised by Hauler (Leipzig, 1898). In pre·
paring the explanatory notes Ι have had this edition
constantly before me, and have also consulted the best-
known English and American editions, to all ol which 1
arn considerably indebted. ’

Most ol the illustrations in the text are reproductions
of those with which the Vatican MS. of Terence is
adorned. This MS. dates srorn the tenth century, and
Ι at the beginning os each play a complete group is given
ol the masks representing all the characters, while at
the beginning os each scene some special incident is
also illustrated. Only a selection os these miniatures
is given in this edition.

For convenience¹ sake the references in the notes are
to page and line. But the continuous numbering is indi·
cated in the headline ol each page os the text, and also
in the table on page 120.
