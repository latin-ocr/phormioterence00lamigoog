INTRODUCTION xxvii

any unaccented syllable. In other words, Plautus and Terence,
like our own poets, scan by ear and not by the hard-and-fast rules
of prosody with which we are familiar in the verse of the Augustan
poets. Consequently-

(i) Final syllables wlt‘ch we generally regard as short are scanned
us long estha accentsalls on tlem‚· e.g.:

ostetlt, 260 angerlt, 245 aoetdt'n, ²97 quaeerit

(ii) Vowels long by nature, le. coming before two comonanls
either in tlte same word or dividae between two words, may be
slorlened is unaccented; e.g.:

9 supdllectile 34⁶ senex. 307 nempe, 725 uoluntate, lpslus, 557 imenb, 546

parirmne, 866 neque intelleges, 666 ob decem minas, 937 enirn uero, 35² uegit
Phanium, 601 peter uenit. ,

(iii) Fz'nal vowels long by nature may be shorlened is unaccmled,·
e.g.: ·

346 uide, 59 abi, 261 dari, 787 uiri, 97² noud, and ln oue instance a long vowel is
shortened when not final. 9⁰2 uerebtmini.

[In 27 and 982 we have remarkable instances ol the influence
ol verse-accent, where a final long vowel and m preceded by a
vowel are not elided before a following vowel, but carry the ictus
and are treated as short syllables:

2⁷ qul rget, ⁹⁸² alm eso]

Symeesis, or the blending together of two distinct vowel sounds
in the same word, is ol frequent occurrence, aga 411le
355 eles, 562 lentus, 668 prolude, 971 hll’w also deles, nu'zls,
azir, ret'cere, &e

lentus also occurs, though rarely: (i) in the caesura ol' iambic
lines, eg. 273 (ri) aster interjections, eg. 411, 8033 (iii) when there
is a change of speaker, ag. 146, 9633 and (iv) in the special
instances quoted above, 27 qui agel, 982 dum ego.
