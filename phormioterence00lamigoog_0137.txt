36. contra, a preposition as in Adel. 44, ille contra haecomnia ruri agere
uitam3 Pl. Pers. 13, quis illic est, qui coartra me astat? This repositional
use isdenied sor Terence by Wagner, who regards it as ana verb in both
passages, appr} punctuates accordingly, nunc contra ommia haec: supplying
erent or sc mr.

39. quam ad. See Critical Notes

4o liaeo el anhaoesslh. Lewis and Short give the meaning of ‘precede'
in quoting this passage, but the verb· (antecessit) contains the further notion
of ‘havrng the advantage over'3 Dono means that the da on which he has
had a definite offer for the girl isa better day sor him than that on which

ppypaept has only been promised. Trans. ε ‘This day has taken precedence

2. quod, ie. argentumr ‘which had been promised rue, ifthis fellow

could have been induced to grant me this three days' grace '. Exoro and
other verbs of arking, when used actively, take two accusatives, one of the
person and the other of the thing: cg. hoc tc rogo, ⁴1 ask you for this';
when the verb is used passively the thing asked for remains in the accusa·
tive, as here, triduom lroc.

4. dtxti=dixisti ; cf. duxti, misti, sor duxisti, arrisisti. “The shortened
lorms are the result of the tendency to drop one of two similar neighbouring
syllables. We have dixti for daisti, but not, eg„ cepsti lor capi-sti, where
the two syllables have not similarity ol sound’ (Lindsay, p. 100.) Cf.
note to 197 (ii. 2. 19).

6. equidem, a strengthened form of quidem, and not derived from ego
and quidem. It is used by Terence with any person, and is not confined
to the first: as, e.g.‚ Eun. 956, atque equidm orante, utne idsacmt,
natm Adel. 899, occidunt mc equidem, dum nt‘rmi sanctas nuptias
student facere. So, too, in Plautus, Trin. 611, atque equidem ipsus ultro
uenit. “Equidem regularly replaces quidem in Plautus and Terence in
such phrases as atqrae cpuiim, quando equidem. . . . So scio equidem
always, not scio quidem) (Gray on Plaut. T rin. v. 353.)

9. ltane‘l ‘reallyl' 'yesi’ The word is generally used in a surprised
or indignant question, with a somewhat ironical soree.
