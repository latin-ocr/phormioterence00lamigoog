uon ΗΜΘ ei plaudite. This appeal for a plause was addressed to
the audience, and rs the usual termination of e plays of Terence and
Plautus. In Terence the appeal is always simple, enerallyin the words
here used, though sometimes we have the single word plauditc; in Plautus
the ending is occasionally more elaborate, as, ag„ in the Captiui. The
cantor to whom the words are given is generally supposed to be a singen
to whom were assigned all the passages that were set to music, the actor
merely accompanying the music with appropriate gestures. Cf. Hor. A. P.
154, donec cantor ‘uos plaudite’ dicat. In the MSS., however, he is
designated by the letter Ως end as all the actors were designated by letters,
it is more reasonable to suppose that the symbol Ω refers merely to the
last speaker, who spoke the words in the name of the company. The
theory that a special cantor delivered the words is based upon the quotation
from Horace given above, and on Bentley's conjecture that 0 or ω was
a corruption for ca, i.e. cantor.
