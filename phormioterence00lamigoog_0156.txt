175 (ii. r. 23). mtlnere an amorem emittere. Tm Mss. give retinere
ornare ancittere. The reading given in the text is from a con‘ecture of
Goldbacher (Wien. stud. vii, r 2). Hauler in his revision of ziatzko’s
second edition retains the MS. reading, the objection to which is that it
leaves the verbs without any object, and also weakens the parallelism with
amittendi. . . retinendi in the next line. This second objection also applies
to Dziatzko's reading, retinere amorem an mittere.

243-245 (ii. 3. 13-15). These verses are quoted by Cicero (Tusc. Disp.
iii. 14 30) in the following form :-
pericla, damno peregre rediens semper secum cogitet

aut fili peccatum aut uxoris neortem aut rnorbumfiliae,
communia esse hacc, nequid bomem unquam aeccliat animo nouom.

Dziatzko brackets 243 asan interpolation on the ground of chan e from
plural to singular verb (ferant to cogitet), the omission of a suiject to
cogitet, and the substantival use of rede'em. The fact, however, that the
verse is uoted by Cicero, though with a slight variation (as in 245), which

i uoting from memory, seems conclusive that it was found

may be ue to

at ang rate in {iceros copy. For rediens used substantively cf. creans

in 75 (iv. 6. 29). Α subject to cogitet is easily supplied in thought.

Hauler (revision of Dz.’s second edition, 189) ingenious tries to
make outa rallelism between the three general objects, pericia, damona,
exilia, and t e three special objects mentioned in the next line, so that by
chiasmus eccilia refers to fili peccatum, the ‘exile' being the foreign service
1n Asia whrch was the usual resource of the ‘bad lot of the family (see,
sanititatemilliniti}tthhihttttlffhbtih
presumably to the peril oi danger arising from h'is daughter’s illriess, morbum
filiae. This interpretation of a much-vexed passage is certainly ingenious

and attractive.

. 328 (iii. 1. 14). Bracketed as spamam by Da, who finds a difficulty in the
single tum; but cf. Ter. Ana 2 :

tot me inpediunt curae. . . amor, misericordia
huius, nuptiarum sollicitatio, tum patris pudor.

The only natural object to notri is, as he says, eos, supplied from homoinem
but he thinks the whole expression is inconsistent wrth the character of
Phormio. But may Phormio not mean that the more he gets to know men
and their little weaknesses the oftener he lays upon them? Elmer takes
the object of noui to he pedum uriom in geg (iii. 1. 12) (‘ the better I know
the path the oftener 1 tread it'); but even if this meaning could be extracted
from the Latin it scarcely makes such good senseas the interpretation {Nm
above, and, moreover, the position of the verbsisrainer saganam·
