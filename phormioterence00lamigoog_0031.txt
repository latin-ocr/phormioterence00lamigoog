appeal and have the case retried, but that, he reminds him, is an ’

expensive game.

· Meanwhile Chremes comes horne. He has been absent in the
island of Lemnos, where it turns out that he has long had a second
establishment, consisting of a wife and a daughter named Phanium.
ln point of fact, he had gone to Lemnos ostensibly to look after his
wife’s property there, but in reality to gather news of his Lemnian
wife and daughter. On arriving at Lemnos, however, he hears that
they have already sailed to Athens in search of him, and so he
returns. This Lemnian connection, though kept a profound secret
from his Athenian wife, Nausistrata, who was a bit of a shrew, was
well known to his brother Demiph0, and it had been arranged
between thern that the girl Phanium should marry Demipho’s son
Antipho. Consequently, Chremes is as much put out as Demipho
to hear of Antipho’s marriage, and when Phormio comes forward
and offers to solve the difficulty by taking the girl himself ‘for a
consideration ’, he urges his brother to close with the offer, and
even advances the necessary funds—which, by the way, were part
of the proceeds of the sale of Nausistrata's property in Lemnos.
Phormio pitches his price pretty high, alleging that he is already
engaged to another girl, whose parents will have to be bought
off. This is, of course, a fable; what he really wants the money
for is to hand it over to his friend Phaedria to buy his music-girl
with, which he does. Chremes, however, soon learns the true state
of affairs, for he happens to come face to face with Sophrona, the
old nurse who had corne over with Phanium and her mother.
From her he hears that his Lemnian wife has just died in Athens,
and that Antipho has married Phanium—for it was she, as it tums
out, who had won the young fellow's love and sympathy at her
mothePs funeral Chremes at first does not understand that these

two marriages of Antipho’s are really one and the same, and his ·

horror-stricken ejaculation, “ What, has he two wivesl'’ coming
from the master of a dual establishment, is full of point and
humour. Sophrona, however, soon reassures him, and then of
course both he and Demipho, whom he informs of the true state
of the case, are anxious to recover from Phormio the money they
have given him Phormio, however, as has been said, has already
parted with it to Phaedria, and has to make a bold move to get out
of his difficulties. He has possessed himself of the secret of the
Lemnian family and rums his knowledge to good account. When .
