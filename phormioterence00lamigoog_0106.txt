¹ DIDASCALIA

diiunguntur were short notices prefixed to the worlrs oi the Greek
dramatists, giving information conceming the authorship of the play, the

date of its productim, the success it met with, and other detais. The
source from which the information was derived was probably the original
‘acting copies' belonging to the stage-manager or actors. These notices
were tirst systematically arranged by the Alexandrine school, and the
practice was adopted by the latin grammarians of the second century ne.
for the Latin dramatists. It is from these grammarians, and chiefly from
the work of M. Terentius Varro (De artri scaem'cis), that the diduscaliae for
the plays of Terence are derived.

2. Ludis Romanis. These, the most important of the Roman gemes,
were held annually in September in honour of Ju iter, Juno, and Mrnerva.
They consisted principally of gladiatorial shows, xing competitions, and
theatrical representations. Most of the extant Latin plays were produced
either at these games or at the Ludi Megalenses held in April.

4. aedilibus curulibus. These magistrates, besides being responsible
for all the police arrangements of the crty and the care of the streets and
public buildings, were specially entrusted with the or nization of the
public games, a duty which they frequently performed wit the most lavish
expenditure ol their private fortunes‚ in order to secure the good-will of the
people in future elections.

5. egli, ‘brought out ’, ele. he was the manager and truiner of the
troupe of actors‚ corresponding to the Greek χοροδιδάσκαλος.

1.. Ambiuius Turpio, a popular actor and stage-manager, whose
name appears in the didascaliae to all the plays of Terence. Cicero, de
Senec. 14, refers to him in complimentary terms: Ut Turpione Ambr'uio
magis delectatur qui in prirua cauea spectat, delectatur etrum qui in
ultima.

L. ututur Praenestinus. This name occurs in conjunction with that
of Turpio in all the didascalicae to the plays ol Terence, and should pro·
bobly be referred to some later representation ol the play.

6. modos teuit Tleouur Gluudl. ‘Flaccus (the slavel ol Claudios, eom-
posed the music ’, as he did for all the plays ol Terence. Tne mm
citizen considered such occupations as music, danc‘iug, and uem ὃ Ψ
