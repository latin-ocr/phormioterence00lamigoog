78 prronnno

70. indotatam. The dowry (das, προῖξ, φερνή) was a very important
factor in Greek marriage arrangements, as it constituted the chief distinction
between the legal wife and the concubine. It was always regarded as the
exclusive possession of the wife (and children), audather death it reverted
either to the children or to the wife's relations, who had provided it.
Below, in 125 (i. 2. 75), 410 (iii. 2. 63), Terence refers to the law by which
a poor heiress was either to be married or dowered by her nearest male
relative, the amount os the dowry being stated as five minae. See Dict.
Antip, s.v. Dos.

72. quid fiat? subjunctive, beoause it is a repetition in an indirect
form of the previous quidfit?

73. qui; either locative or abl. of the relative, and frequently used by
the cornio poets like nt and utinam to emphasize a wish; eg. luppiter,
ut pereat positum robigine telum (Hor. Sat. ii. 1. 43); qui illum di onrms
perduint (Plaut. Men. 451). In 130 (i. 2. 80) below it is used as an inter-
rogative adverb, qui cogitata tibi sit.

perduint. The forms duim, duint, arduini, δια, are to be regarded
as relies of an archaic optative, and the act that Terence has, besides this
lorm, the form perdant (Eun. 302, ut illum di perdant) in the same sense
points to the coexistence of optative and subjunctive forms in Early Latin,
tilre loratlrter ogd which, as being superfluous, gave way to the latter in the
cassrc perr .

75. lex, introduced by Solon. Cf. note to indotatam, 70 (i. 2. 70). All
cases included under this law were heard before the archon at Athens, who
assigned (ἐπιδικάζειν) the orphan girl to her nearest male relative, who
either provided her with a dowry or married her. In the latter oase he
was sard ἐπιδικάζεσθαι, from which comes the title of Apollodorus' play,
ἐπιδικιιζόμειος ; see note in the Didascalia.

77. scribam dormanno δίκην, ‘1 will indict you '. Ci 440 (iii. 2,
92), dicam tibi impingam grandnm. - ι

79. qui for quin cf. 990 (ν. 9. 97), note.

80. qul, note to 73, above.

81. ‘I will trurnp up all this, just as will suit me best.’ Dr. and others
punctuate confingam quad, with a comma at commodum.

83. quid meat Supply refert, ‘what do I carel’ ‘what isthat to me?’

84. ttoculorum audactam, ‘jolly cheekt'-the so-oalled exclamatory
accusa lve-

85. homini, ie. Antipho; uentumrt, i.e. adiudicat, 129 (i. 2. 79). For
the change of tense cf. 53.

87. quid te futurumst? ‘what will become ofyou?’ Te is the ablative
ol the means; the construction (with fini, facere, esse) is common in Plautus,
Terence, and Cicero,· ag. Plaut. Mart. 1166, quid mestit? Cic. Vm. ii. 2.
16, quanin iamim facias? Cf. te idem malins feraris, aab titi. a. ¹19).
