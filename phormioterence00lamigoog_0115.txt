36. ludum, ie. the music-school which she attended.

redducere. This spelling, given by codex D, retains the suffix re in a
fuller form. [Lindsay (Hist. Lat. Graux, p. 134) connects the d with the
particle ale seen, cg„ in the Gk. biarche] This form remains in classical
Latin in red-eo, the dbeing also seen in prad-ca. In Prol. 21 we have rel·
latum=red-latum. Most MSS. give reducere in this passage, and that both
forms were allowable isseen by such spellings as relliquiae, reccidere, rellatus
pcfcuhping at thte samIe period sgde by side with rilt'queae, rica‘elere, ritatus.

37. otiosi, ‘havingnothing else to do '.

38. exaduersum ilico, ‘rightopposite'3 c'lr'ca most probably from in
and laco. Cf. Plaut. Τ rin. 608, ilico hic ante ostium.

39. tonstrina. The barber's shop both in Rome and Athens (κουρεῖον)
was used as a fashionable resort for idlers, where politics and local news
were discussed and probably much scandal originated ; in this respect they
resembled the London coffee-houses of Dr. Johnson's times. Cf. Hor. Sat.
i. 7. 3, opinor anmibus reatum tonsoribus esse. Arist. Plut. 337, καίτοι
λόγος 'ys ἢν, νὴτὸνἭρακλέοι, πολύς ἐπὶ τοῖσι κουρείοισι τῶν καθημένων. The
duties of the barber were multifarious‚ including shaving or clipping of the
beard and hair, the trimming of the nails of hands and feet, and the

4ο. dum iret. Dum with present or imperfect subj. expresses an
event expected or purposed, ‘until'; with the present ind (rarely with
other tenses) it expresses time only, as in the next line, dum sedemus; an'
event expected is however sometimes treated as if it occupied the period of
waiting, and dum is followed by the indicas in Plaut. Most. 683, ego hie
tantisper, dum exis, tc opperiar saris, with which cf. v. 420 of this play,

haud desinam donec perfecero troc. Roby, ἕξ 1663, 1664, 1669.

41. illi, the locative of ille, which in classical Latin always has the
particle -ce added, illic3 see note to istaec, 77 (i. 2. 27).

42. mirarier. This archaia form of the pres. inf. passive is very fre-
quent in early poets, and is occasionally employed by writers of the classioal
period, cg. Hor. Od. iv. 11. 8, spargier ; it rs especially common in old
legal inscriptions, ag. in the S. C. de Bacchanalibus, figier, gnoscier.

The ‘historic infinitive’, which is especially common in Latin comedy
and in the more animated passages of prose authors, gives the idea of the
verb in a much more indefinite way than a finite mood. Its frequent
occurrence in the colloquial Latin of Plautus and Terence makes it evrdent
tiltaat litf must have entered very largely into the common languagc of every·

y re. .

The indefinite character imparted to an idea by the infinitive moodis
clearly seen in the so-called ‘exclamatory infinitive’, as, ag„ in 153 (ii. 1. 1)
of this play, adeon rem redisse, ‘ to think that matters have come to such a
pass'; and reuereri, 233 (ii. 3. 3).

44 utrumne. Notice the participle attracted into the gender of onus.

45. ulamma, probably genitive depending on hic, as in Andr. 7ο, huc
