INTRODUCTION xxv

Demipho and Chremes threaten him with violence if he does
not restore the money, he summons Nausistrata from her house
and discloses everything, much to the discomfiture of Chremes.
Demipho, however, soothes her anger, and when she realizes that
the rival wife is dead and that the daughter is safely married she
consents to overlook the past, satisfied with the ‘rod in pickle’
which she will always have ready for her erring husband in future
conjugal discussions. And so all ends happily; Phormio is for·
given for tbe trick he has played, and has secured the stake for
which he played his dangerous game‚ namely, a certain welcome
at the dinner·table both of Nausistrata and Phanium.

‘the metres most commonly employed by Terence are-

(i) Iamblo senarius, ie. an iambic (υ -) line of six feet, modelled
on the Greek iambic trimeter, but admitting many 'licenses
Whereas in the Greek iambic the second, fourth and sixth feet
must be pure iambi, in the iambic senan'us of Roman comedy the
iambus may be replaced by a spondee (- -Ι, a tribrach (v υ ν),
a dactyl Ι-υυ), an anapaest (v w), or a proceleusmatic
(ννύυ), in any foot except the last, which is always either
ν - or νυ. This metre is especially adapted‚ by reason of its
freedom, to the ordinary language of everyday life, and is therefore
most used in dialogue. N early half of every play of Terence is
in this metre.

Examples:

53. lectrimst Ι οόηνέιιῖ Ι et Ξ mimir Ι sis quan Ι tr'rm ἀεἸ hdr.

966. &gd re'dlg Ι am uos Ι ln Ξ ςτῐΙῑ Ι iiam) hoc 1 fretis l chremes„

From the above examples it will be seen that the caesura falls
either in the third or the middle of the fourth foot, the former
being the more frequent place ; and that when the proceleusmatic
(υυύν) occurs, its ictus-syllable ΙἸ begins a word; cf. also
