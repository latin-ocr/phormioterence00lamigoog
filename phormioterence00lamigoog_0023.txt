the ease and elegance oi language with which he was familiar
from his daily intercourse with his noble patrons. Even his slaves
seem to catch something ol this all-pervading urbanity, and though
they are witty and lively enough, it is rather with the wit and
liveliness of smart epigram than the broad humour and buffoonery
of the Plautine characters. His plots are therefore more tame in
conception, and, though more artistically handled, are developed
with less vigour oi action, while his characters show even less
variety than those ol Plautus; indeed, it is difficult, from the great
similarity of his characters and the frequent recurrence oi the
same name in different plays, to carry away with us a vivid mental
picture ol any outstanding personality. He shows, however, much
more care than Plautus in keeping close to his Greek originals,
, and is almost entirely free from those distinctly Roman allusioos
’ which often make it difficult for readers ol Plautus to say whether
they are in Rome or Athens; and we have consequently in his
plays a much more realistic and trustworthy picture ol the domestic
life of Athens in the third century lae. This is Terence’s great
gift to the world ; it is from his plays alone that we get this picture,
and without it the world would be the poorer. His more immediate

conversational style, undoubtedly did much to bring to perlection
tha‘t charin and simple dignity ol language which characterize the
letters os Cicero, the epistles and some os the satires and odes οἱ
Horace, and the epigrams ol Martial. Many happy sayings of his
are osten quoted today, proving how applicable they are to human
life of any age; for example, “ ne quid nimis”, “ hinc illae lacrimae’¹,
“quot homines tot sententiae'', “amantium ira amoris integratiost”,
and his famous line, “homo sum, humani nil a me alienum puto”.
His popularity in early times is fully attested by the number of
extant manuscripts os his plays, while in the middle ages his works
were studied with care ln modern times he has met with most
appreciation among the French, “the masters ol the prose of refined
conversation’'. “sainte-Beuve calls Terence the bond ol union
between Roman urbanity and the Atticism ol the Greeks, and
