118 PHORMIO

356 (iii. 2. 9). This verse was seen by Bentley to be obviously spurious,
as in 386 (iii. 2. 39) Phormio has to get Geta to prompt him as to the

ut narras, ‘look at yourself and him—what a talel eie. who would believe
your story that a rascal like you had a friend of the high character that you
ascribe to Stilpo. This gives more force to Phormio’s angry rejoinder, i in
νῶιὲἱῖινηι crucem, than either of the interpretations suggested by Bond and

As to the sense, tandem seems more forcible than tamen, and its use is
borne out by the references given in the note to the line.

taken indifferent ways. I give the various interpretations in what seems to
me the order of their probability: (i) neque. . . alia=eadem (Stallbaum), as

524 (iii. 5. 39). quam ad. This is the MS. reading, which is altered to
quoad by Guyet and Bentley (followed by Wagner and others) on the
assumption that a monosyllabic preposition never stands after its case in
Terence. For quoad in this sense cf. Plaut. Pseud. 622, argento haec dies
