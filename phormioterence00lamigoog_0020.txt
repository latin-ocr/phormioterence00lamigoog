INTRODUCTION xiii

Such was the source from which Plautus and Terence drew the
materials for their comedies, and we rnay now briefly compare the
characteristics of these two writers.

Titus Maootus Plautus, ac. 254-184, was a native oi Umbria,
oi humble origin. He came early to Rome, and seems to have
been engaged in some inferior capacity in connection with the
theatre‚ an occupatiori in which he probably acquired his interest
in and 'knowledge of stage-craft Alter somewhat varied fortunes
he turned his attention to writing for the stage, nc. 2243 he won
immediate recognition, and continued almost without a rival in his
own sphere until his death sorry years later. He was a prolific
writer, one hundred and thirty plays having been attributed to him;
of this number, however, only twenty-one were allowed by later
critics to be genuine, and of these we possess all but one, the
Vt'dularia. All the plays of Plautus were borrowed directly from
the Greek, and were os the class known as subulae pallrbtar3 that
is, plays in which the actors wore the Greek dress (pallerem
χλαμύς). By the police regulations of the time, it was strictly for·
bidden to represent on the stage a Roman in the Roman dress
(toga), as being derogatory to the dignity oi the sovereign people

Even when such plays ( subulae togatae) were allowed in later times,
{lssgycfigpicted the life of the ltalian provinces rather than that ol

From his early associations‚ it was natural that Plautus should
show more aptitude in the delineation oi characters oi the lower
and middle classes, among whom he had been brought up, and in
reproducing in all its force and vigour the popular mode oi speech.
He was pre-eminently “the poet of the people”, a fact which is
abundantly attested by the lasting popularity of his plays, which
were revived aster the death os Terence, and continued in favour
until the end os the republican period. There is always a strong
vein of humour running through his plays, but it is humour of a
robust kind-rollicking, boisterous, and not always in the best ol ,
taste, though it doubtless exactly suited his audience. He stands
unrivalled for natural flow of lively dialogue, sor vigorous and well-
sustained action, which keeps the sun going to the enh, lor prthx‘hc
fancy, racy and sparkling wit, and the keenness ot obsessam
