INTRODUCTION xv

Terence marks a new era in the literary taste ol Rome. A new
generation had sprung up, deeply imbued with enthusiasm for
Α Greek art and letters, and carefully educated from their youth up
in Greek accomplishments. The most prominent figure among
these enlightened enthusiasts was Scipio Aemilianus, who gathered
round him a band of kindred spirits, such as Laelius, Philo, Gallus,
and others. Recognizing the undoubted superiority of the Greek
originals, from a literary and artistic point of view, over the Latin
,imitations then in vogue, and stimulated with an ardent desire to
create a national literature that should conform more closely in
form and substance to that of Greece, while at the same time it
* *created among their fellow·countrymen a thirst for Greek culture
and intellectual refinement, this ‘Scipionic circle’ extended their
ready patronage and encouragement to a poet in whom they saw
both the desire and the ability materially to assist their cherished
scheme. ln fact, so intimate did Terence become with its members
that his detractors accused him of having received very substantial
assistance from them in the actual composition of his plays.
Whether the charge is true or false is not very material. Terence,
at any rate, whenever he refers to the accusation, takes no pains
to give a direct denial to it, and it may be that he took a certain
amount of pride in being associated with such men in an intimacy
close enough to justify such an implication, and did not care to
refute it.
What is of more importance is to consider how this intimacy, ,
- and the style of life with which he was familiar in the house os
Lucanus, affected his writings. It has already been pointed out
that the early associations of Plautus had a penmanent influence
on the style and spirit os his plays. Nor was it otherwise with
Terence. Plautus came into close contact with the lower strata os
society, and was therefore more at home in dealing with characters
of that class; Terence moved in a sphere of greater refinement and
more intellectual activity, and his plays are naturally influenced by
his environment. The consequence is, that his pictures of life are
more subdued in tone than those of Plautus, his characters being
iaintly‚ though minutely, drawn, rather than dashed on with the
' strong and vigorous colouring that distinguishes the elder poet.
Without the latter's extravagance of wit and exuberance of animal
spirits, the general atmosphere that pervades the plays of Terence
is one of genial courtesy and urbanity.' His characters behave, for
