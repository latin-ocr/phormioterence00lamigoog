xii PHORMIO

ried girls to be seen abroad in the streets ol Athens, the daugh-
ters oi the house never appear on the stage in these plays, where
all the action is supposed to take place out-os·doors. To this
absence from the sceneos young ladies of refinement and good
breeding is due the feature which differentiates the plays ol

Plautus 3ηά Terence most clearly from the domestic drama oi
today. Whereas in the latter the interest ol the play mainly
centres round the love-romanoe of the hero and heroine, the sonner
is entirely sree from what we should call love-soenes, 3ηά though ‚
the element of love is not entirely wanting, a modern reader leels
that it is rather the shadow than the substance os romance, when
heis left to form his estimate ol the beauty and amiability os the
invisible fair from the assurances of a prejudiced lover. Of other
female characters the most noticeable are the ancient nurse, a sort
of old family retainer, with the welfare of the family keenly at
beart, whose faithfulness is equalled by her volubility; and the pert
young waiting-maid, the veritable prototype os the familiar modern
variety. Lastly, we meet in every play with specimens of that
class of women with which Athens in those degenerate days
abounded—the brilliant, witty, free-mannered hetaerae, with whom
the young sons generally find themselves entangled.

There can be little doubt that the plays of Menander and his
contemporaries gavea very true picture ol Athenian domestic life
of the time. This is the unanimous verdict os antiquity; in the
case of Menander, indeed, there is on record a complimentary
epigram which expresses a doubt as to whether “Menander copied
from nature or nature from Menander”. Even without this direct
testimony we might have inserted that this was the case from the
plays os Plautus and Terence (their professed imitators), which
bear upon them the unmistakable stamp of reality. We see in
them men and women actuated by the same motives, showing the
same follies and weaknesses‚ the same joys and sorrows, the same
interests, the same appetites and passions, as, under similar cir-
cumstances, will animate human beings aslong as human nature
remains the same. And when we remember that a translation or
adaptation must almost of necessity lose something of the spirit
and fire of the original, our study oi Plautus and Terence will
enable us to form a very high estimato of the writers of the N ew
v Comedy, even« though nothing is left to us of their original works
excepta {ew detached fragments ol Menander.
