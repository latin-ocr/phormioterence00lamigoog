astuteness and roguery of the cunning slave to extricate them
honourably. Then the slave himself, without whom no play would
be complete; cunning, unscrupulous, quick to take advantage of
human weakness‚ with a keen eye to his own interest, especially
when he fears the dreaded stocks or whipping-post, he seems to
enjoy¹ the unbounded confidence of his master and a measure of
freedom seldom accorded to the most favoured of modern valets.
The shrewd way in which he plays off one member of the house·
hold against another, the many shifts he makes to save a whole
skin, and the cunning devices he adopts in his apparently congenial
task of smoothing away difficulties and making everything end
happily, all contribute very largely to the action of the piece, and
provide a great part of the comic element.

Two other characters recur with great regularity: the swaggering
soldier of fortune, who has returned from the wars in Asia to
have a good time on the plunder he has there amassed, never
tired of recounting to admiring and fawning friends his deeds of
personal prowess in the “imminent deadly breach”-the literary
forefather of the braggart Bobadil in Jonson's Every Man in his
Humum and the ubiquitous parasite, the professional ‘diner·out’‚
who will do anything for a dinner-a man of inordinate appetite,
of gentlemanly and insinuating address‚ always playing the toady
or worming himself into domestic secrets, the knowledge of which
will secure for him, if he plays his cards adroitly‚ a regular though
perhaps a grudging welcome at the family dinner-table. Familiar
though this character was to an ancient audience, he finds no place
on the modern stage ; nor, fortunately‚ does his even less desirable
brother, the rascally slave-dealer (leno) with his seandalous trade.
Among the female characters we have the wife of the old man,
generally a shrew and emphatically the ‘better-half'‚ of whom her
husband stands in awe, though occasionally it is the latter who
plays the domestic tyrant; whichever it be, there is always some
fun to be got out of the ⁴ family jars '.

lt is, however, pleasing to note that in the new comedy conjugal
infidelity is looked upon as a thing to be reprobafed, and not
as the natural concomitant of the married state, as it was in the
time of Aristophanes and his contemporaries. The morality of

the comedies is not, indeed, above reproach,¹ but the relations
of husband and wife at any rate 010 respected. ln eodemne
