NOTES 73

9. unciatim. Adverbs were originally for the most part casas of nouns,
adjectives, and pronouns. The cases most frequently found in Latin are
the accusative (unciatim, partim, plerumque, perperam), the ablative or
instrumental (valde, vero), and the locative (fori's, recta, extra). (Lindsay,
Hist. Lat. Gr., ch. vii.) In English some adverbs similarly show remains
of case-endings, eg. whiles‚ whilom, seldom.

demenso eun. The demensum was the monthly (or daily) dole given
out to slaves for their own sustenance. It consisted of wheat, oil, wine,
salt, figs, and olives. It was by carefully saving out of these supplies that
a slave hrpapaggd to acquire a little property (pecudem), frequently enough
to buy ‘s ree om.

ro. genium The Roman genius was a sort of spiritual self born (cf.
gigno) and perishing along with every individual, whose sorrows and {oya
lrkes and drslrkes, rt shared. Hence ιιι such phrasesasmdugc gente( ers.
Sat. v. 151), furtde merum gemo (Pers. Sat. ii. 3), genium curare (Hor.
Oa'. ιιι. 17. 14), it is equivalent to ‘a man's own self'. Besides the present

11. uniuersum, ‘at one swoop ².

12. parium supply sit. The omission of the copula, when it should
be in the subj. mood, is rare in etl periods of the language3 but in the

13. ferretur allo 1111111919, ‘will be run in for another present ¹, as we
might say. The metaphor in ferietur is especially appropriate in the mouth
of a slave, to whom the ‘lash ' was doubtless only too familiar.

ubl era pepererit Among the Greeks, on the tenth day aster birth

the child was formally acknowledged by the father and received a name,

presents at the same time being given both to the child and the mother.

’ The toys given to the children were made of metal or clay; Plautus (Rud.

4. 110) has 9 list of the usual kind of playthings given, ag. little golden

swords, silver pigs, rings, half-mouns, &c Presents were also given on

the anniversaries of the birthday; in the caseos the slaves this must have
been 9 severe tax on their small savings.

15. ubl initiabant. The meaning of this vexed passage was far from
clear even to the ancient commentatore Donatus ιιι his note on these
words quotes Varro to the effect that infants were ‘initiated' or ‘eonse-
crated’ to certain divinities when they were weaned‚ and this is the meaning
given to initiabant by several modern editors. The cerenrony‚ however,
was a purely Roman one, and Terence is not likely to have found a refer·

word place 9 comma at rmtalri ἀίει, making the ‘wenning' edxne'xdenxyixxffn
