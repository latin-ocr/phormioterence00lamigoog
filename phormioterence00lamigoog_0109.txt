70 PHORMIO

1. poete uetus, ie. Luscius Lanuvinus, an older contemporary and
jealous rival of our poet. His name appears as a detractor of Terence in

the prologue to every play except the Hecyra. For the charges he brought
against hun, see Introduction, p. xv.

his poletam. Terence, unlike Plautus, never mentions his own name in
proogues.

2. transdere, archaic for tradere.

4. fabulae. The plays which Terence had produced previous to
Phormio were Hecyra, Hautou Timorumcuos, and Eunuchus. The
Hecyra was very badly received, being hissed off the stage; the Eunuchus,
however, produced in the same year as the Phormio, met with a very
cordial reception, in spite of the attempts of the poet's older rival to
damage his reputation.

5. oratione, the louguage put into the mouths of the various characters:
scriptura, the style of composition=stilus, as in And. Prol. 12 (Audn'o ct
Perinthia), dissimili oratione surii fociae ci stilo. This ‘commonplace
language' and ‘light style' which Lanuvinus condemns in Terence were
exactly the points rn which he excelled as a writer of comedy.

off. The reference is apparently to some scene in a comedy of Lanu-
vinus, in which he introduces a young man in the frenzy of hopeless love
labouring under the delusion that he sees the object of his passion in the
form of a hind pursued by hounds and appealing to himself for protection;
a theme more suited to tragedy than comedy, as, cg, in the Ajox of
Sophocles and the Hip olytus of Euripides.

8. eum plorare. This reminds one of Shakespeare's “poor sequester’d
stag, That froin the hunter's aim had ta’en a hurt”, whose “big round
tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase”, As
You Lihc Ii, act ii, sc. 1. >

9. quod sl, ‘but if ’. The explanation of this and similar combinations
(eg. quod ubi, quod ui, quod utinam) is that the relative quod refers loosely
to the previous sentences, in the sense of ‘as to which ', while thesi, uhi,
ni, dic, introduce the subordinate sentence. Cf. 155 (ii. 1. 3) below, quod
ni fuissem incogitons, ita expectarem ut porsreit; 157 (ii. 1. 5), quod retinam
ne Phormioni iri suadere in urentem incidisset ; and Livy vi. 8. 2, quod uhi
uidere ipsum Camillum uadentem irc hostes, procurrunt3 cf. also Livy,
vr. 7. 2.

quom this is the early spelling of the time of Plautus and Terence,
quum not being prevalent till after the classioal period of Cicero and his
contemporaries, who wrote curii.

stetit ; for the length of final syllable, see Introduction, p. xxvii.
Starc=‘to be successful, opposed to cadere (Hor. Ep. ii. 1. 176, suurus,
cochiton recto stet fabulo tolo) moueri loco (see Prot. 32 of this play), and
exigi (Hec. 15, partim carum sum exactm, partim ccix stetit. The phrases
were originally used of the actors themselves, who were allowed to remain
on the stage or were hissed off according to their merits.

ιο. actoris, ie. the manager of the troupe (dontinus gregis), who was
generally also the chief actor.

relaedit, ‘maligmt
