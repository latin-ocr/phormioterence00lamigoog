88 PHORMIO

78. faxo. This word is properly a sigmatic aorist form. The sigmatic
aorist in Latin had a subjunctive in -o and an optative in -im, which are
used for the sut. perfect and the perf. subjunctive respectively, so that ficxo
(=fac·so) was equivalent to fcccro, facim (πίας-εἰη) to fecerim. Faxcis
used with a future indic. as here, or occasionally a present subjunctive, and
in both cases renthetically, the second verb being ‘logically but not
grammatically ependent’. Roby,§ 1605.

79. adduce. The imperatives dic, duc, sac lost their final -c in the
second century rac, Plautus uses the full forms whenever there is a pause
after the word; cf. Rucl. 124, tu, siquid opus cst, dccc. Dic quod tc rogo,
where we have both forms. Ten, however, is said never to use dice, and
duce only in compounds; sace occurs at the end of a verse, ag. 397 (iii. 2.
50) of this play. Lindsay, p. 28.

81. The first duty os a Greek or Roman on returning from ajourney was ,
gp glive thanks to the ‘household gods' for his saie retum3 so Herakles

is return from Hades is bidden by Amphitryon καλῶς προσελθὼν νῦν
πρόσειπέ θ’ ἑστίαν, Eur. Herc. Fur. 599, 606-609.

83. adeleni. The forms scam, sies, sict were archaic even in the time
os Plautus and Terence, and are only employed at the end oia line. ·

ACT III—SCENE 1

3. oppido, a colloquial word, the derivation of which is doubtful; it was
obsolete in the time of Quintilian.

4. ‘It’s you that have mixed this mess; it’s you must clear it all up:
so brace yourself togetherl' A proverbial ex ression having reference to
the preparing oi some dish, the ingredients oi> which were ‘pounded up'
together (intera). Accingere, passive with the force os a Greek middle.
They German proverb is parallel: du least cs cingebrockt nunu ncusst du
auc csauscsscn.

5. Phormio is oi course soliloquizing, and pays no heed to Geta

ul rogabit, ‘suppose he asks me . . .’ He pauses in silent thought,
then breaks out again, ‘but see here, what it he retorts . . .' rela sing once
more into silence; then triumphantly, ‘I’ve got it (sic), 1 think.. . trot
out the old gentleman’.

eccere occurs only here in Ten, though it is found more frequently in
Plautus. Its derivation is variously given as cccc rcm and cccc rc; others
connect it with Ceres on the analogy of ecastor, edepol ; the length oi the
