NOTES 69

Θ. The best MS. of Terence (the Bembine, known as A) has G. as an
abbreviation lor Gaius in the five periochae which it preserves. The sym·

bol G was invented about the thir century ac. to distinguish the guttural

gsound from the sharp k·sound‚ both os which had been prevrously

‘tantillam {theinnanhtttnhtnhhttr tt

{y the time the peractas were written G. and Gn. were apppdrcently inore
equent.

PROLOGUS

Pege Ι

It appears from Haut. Tim. Pral. vv. 1-2, and Her. Prol. ii. 1, that one
of the younger and less well-known members of the acting company was
chosen to recite the prologue, and that he was dressed m some special
costume. The prologues to the plays of Terence contain merely what the
poet personally wishes to say to the audience (resembling in this respect
the παράβασις of the old Attic Comedy), andare chiefly devoted to sels·
delence ' st adverse criticism and to general detaiis as to bne source
