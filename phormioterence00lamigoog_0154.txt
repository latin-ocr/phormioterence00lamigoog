Demipho, he says, to make light of his brother's vices reminds Phormio
01 the customary laudatio fatebris, in which the virtues 01 the de arted
were extolled and his vices palliated. Phormio’s interruption wouli then
be equivalent to ‘he's making a funeral oration ’. Mortuo would still, 01
course, have reference to 994, 1026.

thus exposing Chremes: ‘well, well, let him be restored to your favour3
I'm quite satrsfied with his punishment ’.
