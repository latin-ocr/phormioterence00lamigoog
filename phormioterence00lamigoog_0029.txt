came into vogue some timeafter his death. The masks were
always combined with suitable wigs and beards, all being made in
one piece, and were typical of persons of a particular age or class;
thus we are told ol nine different masks for comic old men, ten for
young men, seven sor slaves, and no less than sourteen for young
women. The audience by these means knew at once when an
actor came on to the stage the particular character he was to repre·
sent. ln the time os Terence characters were distinguished merely
by the colour and shape os their wigs and heards, and in all proba·
bility artificial means ol ‘making up’ the sace were freely adopted.

actionus the piece takes place invariably in some Greek town,
generally Athens. The stage, therefore, represents an open street
or square, and the background consists oi two or three private
houses‚ inhabited by the chief characters of the play. Between
the houses there are narrow lanes or alleys leading directly into
the open streets, into which a character would retire when he
wished to be hidden from the other actors on the stage; an

ι arrangement which must be remembered when considering the

actionus such passages as Phormio v. 348 soll, 728 foll, 841 foll,
which would otherwise appear somewhat strained and unnatural.
According to the usual convention of both the Greek and the
Roman 'theatre, the left of the stage as one laced the audi·
ence was supposed to lead to some other part os the town,
while the right led to the harbour or the country. The extant
plays os Plautus and Terence are all divided into five acta, but
this division was not in all probability marked by the poets them-
selves, nor is it found in· the oldest manuscripts; it was apparently
left to the discretion of the stage-managei to decide where a break
should occur in the action or‘ the piece. All the manuscripts, how-
ever, show a division into scenes, a new scene being marked when·
ever a fresh actor enters the stage, and each scene being introduced
by a list os all the actors appearing in it. The interval between
the acts was no doubt filled up with the musicos the double flute;
music was also employed to accompany those portions ol the play
(cantica) which were not strictly narrative or dialogue (diuerbia);
the latter passages were written in lambic senarii and were un·
accompanied, while the cantr'ca were in trochaic or iambic sep-
tenatii or octonarii and were recited-to musical accompaniment,
answerrirg very closely to ‘recitative' passages in modern music.
