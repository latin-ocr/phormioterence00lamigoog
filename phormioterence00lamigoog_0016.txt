1. Tun Auernus Come Danum

Our knowledge of the Roman Comic Drama is drawn entirely
from the works that have come down to us of the two great Roman
playwrights, Plautus and Terence. As their plays, however, were
in every instance either translations or adaptations of Greek

from which they drew. There is no branch, perhaps, of the liter·

and in the interval the fortunes of Athens and the temperament of
