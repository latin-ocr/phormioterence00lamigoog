political and personal allusion which characterized the Old Comedy
was no longer possible. Even Aristophanes himself, in his latest
play, the Plutus, shows signs of the coming change, and by the
time the New Comedy has established itself, the change is com·
plete. The Old Comedy, with its keen political satire, its extrava-
gant burlesque, its rude, unpolished but brilliant wit, has given
placeto the quieter humour, the more domestic and cosmopolitan
interest of the ‘new' comedy of manners, of which the plays of
Plautus and Terence, aud indeed the whole drama of to-day, are
the direct lineal descendants. The chief writers of this new school
of comedy were Menander (ae. 342-292), and his contemporaries
Philemon, Diphilus, and Apollodorus.

N ew Comedy depended for their success more on fine delineation
of character aud the quiet humour of everyday life, than on the
boisterous and farcical burlesque of Aristophanes aud his school.
Their productioris are, therefore, somewhat tame in comparison
with the vigorous wit and buffoonery of the earlier dramatists; but
what they lose in vigour they gain in decorum and iu the greater
truthfulness to nature with which they depict the varying phases
of human nature. In this respect it has been charged against them
that they show but very little variety in their characters. This is
unquestionably true, but it must also be remembered that, com·
pared with modern times, the field from which they drew was very
limited. M any a character and manya phase of life with which
< the modern play-goer is familiar on the stage of to-day was (per-
haps happily) utterly unknown io the ancient world. lt is, however,
undoubtedly wearisome to find the same kind of character con-
stantly recurring with monotonous regularity. Given any particular
play of the new-comedy period, we know beforehand with practical
certainty the characters that will confront us. We shall see a
respectable old gentleman, a well-todo citizen living generally in
town and having a comfortable little country property hard by the
city; he will be either mild and generous, an easy prey for his
spendthrift soh and cunning slave, or a hard and miserly old fellow,
whom the audience will take all the more delight in seeiug cheated
and hoodwinked and forced to part with his cherished hoard of
gold Then there will be the young sons of the old men, typical
men about town, careless and light-hearted, generally entangled in
some amour, creditabl'e or otherwisefrom which it requires all the
