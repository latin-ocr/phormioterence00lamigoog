os some great man, The persor-mance usually took place between
noan and three u’clock, and only one play seems ιο heve hoen
given on any one dny; ιιο prizes were offered, as in Greece, sor
eompetition between the poets. Among the Romans actozs were
u ι class much despised; Roscius, however, the celebrated
eomedian ancl friend of Cicero, was a notahle exception. They
were invariably slaves or sreedrnen, and in the time os Plautus
and Terence it was the practice sur several actors to combine
together in n company (grex). under the control os a manager
(dominus gregis), who frequently, as in the case of Plautus, wrote
the plays which his company noted, end himself mol< the leading
