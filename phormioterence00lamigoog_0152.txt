83. malum quud. Malum is here not the exclamatory accus, as in 723
(iv. 5. 11), but is to be taken closely with quod, which is the indefinite and
not the relative pronoun. Tr. ‘may all the gods and goddesses send some
' curse on the lellow'. cf. Plaut. Pseud. 1129, malum quod tibi de’ dabunt.
The verse is rejected by some editors as it occurs in Plaut. Most. 655.
