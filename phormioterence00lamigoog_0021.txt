xiv 2. PHORMIO

⁴ with which he seizes upon and hits off in a few graphic touches
the mannetisms and outward peculiarities of men; and lastly, he
excels in producing comic'efsects, and has athis command a rich
and varied vocabulary, while he displays much ingenuity in the
invention of strange and high-sounding expressions. All the plays
of Plautus have Latin titles, and although the characters have
Greek names and are clad in Greek dress, and though the scenes
are laid in Greece, much of the manner and spirit of the plays is
undoubtedly Roman, and the frequent allusions to the life and
customs, 3ηά even to the buildings of Rome, give a distinctly
Roman flavour to the comedies of Plautus, in marked contrast to
those of his younger rival. θ

Publius uerendus Afer, ac. 185-159. Terence was said to be
by birth a Carthaginian. He was brought to Rome at a very early
age as the slave of the senator M. Terentius Lucanus, who, recog-
nizing his ability, had him carefully educated 3ηά brought up, and

, soon gave him his freedom. He was of slight build and medium

height, and had the dark complexion of his race. The following
is a list ol his six plays, all of which are still extant, with the dates
of their productiori :-

Andria, at the ludi Megalenses, nc. 166
Hecyra (first unsuccessful productiori), ‚, „ ,‚ „ 165
Heauton timarumaaos,- - - ,‚ „ ‚, ‚. 163
Eunuchus, · · · · · „ „ „ ‚, 161

Aemilius Paulus, „ ¹160
Adelphoe, ‚, ludi funeralcs of
Aemilius Paulus, ,‚ 160

Hecyra (third and successful productioni „ ludi Romani. „ 160

All these six plays were received with great favour, though the
Hecyra failed at its first two representations owing to counter
attractions (cf. Phar. Prol. 31 fs.; Hec. Prol. i and ii). After the
final and successful productiori of the Hecyra, uc. 160, Terence

left Rome for Greece, probably to study on the spot the life and
customs ol the people, 3ηά to provide himself with materiale for
future plays. From this voyage, however, he never returned. He
died in the following year, Bc. 159, either by shipwreck or, ac-
cording to another legend, at Stymphalus, in Arcadia, from grief
at the news that the ship that was conveying his manuscripts of
several new translations from Menander had been lost at sea
